This is code-base for all the main concepts of [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) which I have tried myself out.

The code are written in the same order as how the topics goes in the main concepts section of [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) 

I have used the root container for rendering all the modules and I just replace component to be rendered (I know it's too inefficient but this helped me refer the old code whenever i started on a new topic )

You can refer the order of commits in order to find out the module/concept the code belongs to or refer to the comments of the code.
